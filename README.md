# InvDesFlow-AL
The discovery of novel functional materials with targeted properties remains a fundamental challenge in materials science. In this work, we propose InvDesFlow-AL, an active learning-based generative framework for inverse materials design, which iteratively optimizes material generation towards desired properties.

## The complete code will be open-sourced after the paper is officially published.
